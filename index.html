              Hi - Nice to meet ya!  My name is Garrett Steed and I would invite you to read on to learn more about who I am.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I child, I wanted to fly fighter jets but now I have a phobia of flying and sell software.  Weird how life works right?  I currently work as an Inside Account Manager at Adobe but I have held quite a few jobs over the years.  Some of these include working for the EPA, being on a chainsaw crew, and researching jaguars in the jungles of Costa Rica. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My current position entails managing the billing and execution of various multi-tiered projects at one time, while maintaining open lines of communication with my marketing counterparts as Adobe. I am responsible for strategically organizing upcoming campaigns, with a focus on building and maintaining the loyalty of both our end customers and partners. Over the past two years, I have contributed to a successful sales and marketing arm and would cherish th ability to build on my experience with my new coding skills. </p>
              <p>
              I am a problem-solver, a self-motivated and a team player. Client satisfaction has driven me to successfully contribute
              to the business development of both the After-Sales and Sales accounts. I know how important business development and relationship building is to every successful organization.
            </p>
